Way to look at a narrative
-not one data set
-use as much of the data as you were given
-don’t fix the problems, find the problems in the correlations
-keep it simple
-story/pretty things
-tell us the story of the data
-diagnose the data
-descriptive analytics (don’t worry about the creative)
-think about what data can be useful in the future (age, gender) (future trends)
-most valuable insights
-automates (elements of interactivity)
-POR (what’s working well and what’s not working well) (cleanest data sets) (What canadians want and don’t want)
